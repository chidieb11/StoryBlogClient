                      want this to be a grind, and we deemed two constructive

                      The top paying programming language is Clojure? Followed by
                      F#, Elixir and Erlang, and a few positions below Scala and
                      LISP, I'm impressed. I don't have almost any knowledge in
                      functional programming, I've heard that has better performance
                      in certain situations (like managing big data), is more
                      predictable, and more readable, but I don't see real use cases
                      for functional programming instead of a traditional approach.
                      What are the advantages of the functional paradigm? In what
                      situations are this languages used? For someone that wants to
                      learn something new, what language do you recommend to learn
                      first? I thought about Haskell or Clojure. Thanks! üôå
